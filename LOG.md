# 100 Days of Code 2018 - Log

##### Day 1: 10/01/2018


**Progress:**
- Set up project, build and unit test environment.

**Thoughts:**
- I'd forgotten how much fun it is to spend an age tweaking your IDE settings to be *just* right

##### Day 2: 11/01/2018

**Progress:**
- Corrected dates (!) and formatting in the markdown files
- Updated project to use C++17 rather than C++14
- Added SDL2 dependency
- Added basic window with two rectangles to represent a depleting bar

**Thoughts:**
- Not as much progress as I'd like, but at least it's a start!
- I've decided this little project will be somewhat a test bed for  getting used to Data Oriented Design principles. To that end, I set up a quick environment in SDL2 since it's something I'm pretty familiar with and doesn't introduce dependency hell, and added a couple of rectangles for my first test.
- The tests *should* be relevant to things that I am either currently working on, or plan to work on in the future, so nothing should be wasted effort.
- Not sure exactly when I got into the habit of placing comment-based separators in my source files, but I find they neatly compartmentalise things for easier reading
