# 100 Days of Code 2018
##### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*
---
##### Participation Dates
10th January 2018 until 20th April 2018
##### Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. Work coding time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub so that anyone can see my progress.*
4. I will update the (Log)[LOG.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.

\* *I am not guaranteed to be able to push code every day as I am often travelling, so this minor bending of the rules will have to do...*
